# MaterialSettingsPlugin

This plugin adds more settings for materials on the Materials pane of the preferences.

This plugin does not change the fact that if a setting value is specified in the "sidebar" settings or in a quality profile, this always overrides the value set for the material. Also note that this plugin will allow you to change settings per material that really, really don't make any sense to set per material (such as in theory the nozzle size and printer dimensions). Don't do that.
